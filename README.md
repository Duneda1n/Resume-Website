# Personal Resume Website

## General Info

This is a customized resume website theme. modified from the original idea created by [here](https://github.com/bchiang7/v4) and edited by [here](https://github.com/andresjosehr/andresjosehr-portfolio)

The original project was created in ReactJS (in Britanny's project). Andre then made an iteration based in the Angular framework which madde it easier for me to work on that as a base. Finally it can be upgraded with the addition of more live features  such as a more dynamic UX design with smart features (chat bot , universal language conversion, better browser compatibility and so on).


### Prerequisites

In order for the project to run and edited Npm and Angular CLI are needed.the npm commands can be accessed through Node.js [here](https://nodejs.org/es/).
 The next step is to set up Angular CLI in the machine. To do so typoe the following command in the terminal.

``` bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

### Installation

``` bash
npm install
```

### We are ready to go!

The final step you need to do is to type the following:
```bash

```
Since the app is compiled open the following address in an internet browser of your choice : [http://localhost:4200]
